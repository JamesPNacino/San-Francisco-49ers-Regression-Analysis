The data for this analysis is provided by: **http://www.pro-football-reference.com/**


##Method

Using R software we can analyze various correlations between the explanatory variables and response variables using linear regression. Linear regression seemed to be a signifcant model for testing many of the explanatory variables. We found that many p-values were less than an alpha of .05 when testing different explanatory variables. Linear regression was a correct fit for many of the analyses. This was proven due to residual analysis of the data points, making linear regression a significant machine learning model for this dataset.
